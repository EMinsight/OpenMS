In this folder, we will implement MLWF-based density matrix dynamics in crystals
i\hbar\partial\rho_K(t)/\partial_t = [H_k,\rho_k] + \mathcal{L}_{scatt} + \mathcal{L}_{eph}

where 1) \mathcal{L}_{ee} accounts for the electron-electron scattering
      2) \mathcal{L}_{eph} accounts for the electron-phonon scatterings


This code is based on my previous implementation of hot-carrier relaxation
in EPW. It contains two major features: 1) computation of plasmon damping
and hot-electron generation (via different machanisms, e-e, e-ph, e-surface
scatterings), 2) Momentum and energy-resolved real-time hot-carrier relaxation.

PS: This code may be re-arranged into a separate package.
