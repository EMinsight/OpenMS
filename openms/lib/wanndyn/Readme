In this folder, we will implement MLWF-based density matrix dynamics in crystals
i\hbar\partial\rho_K(t)/\partial_t = [H_k,\rho_k] + \mathcal{L}_{scatt} + \mathcal{L}_{eph}

where 1) \mathcal{L}_{ee} accounts for the electron-electron scattering
      2) \mathcal{L}_{eph} accounts for the electron-phonon scatterings


PS: This code may be re-arranged into a separate package.
