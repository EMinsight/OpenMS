Optimizers
==========


A collection of optimizers, including:

  - Newton-Conjugate-Gradient algorithm (Newton-CG)


Newton-CG method:

Newtonâ€™s method is based on fitting the function locally to a quadratic form:

.. math::
    f(x) \approx f(x_0) + \nabla f(x_0) (x-x_0) + \frac{1}{2}(x-x_0)^T H(x_0) (x-x_0)

where :math:`H(x_0)` is the Hessian.
