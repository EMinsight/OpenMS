How to cite
===========

A general citation to the OpenMS package is appreciated.
The Bibtex entry is::

  @Misc{OpenMS,
    title = {Openms: A Multiscale ecosystem for solving coupled Maxwell-SchrÃ¶dinger equations in Open quantum environments},
    author = {Yu Zhang},
    url = {https://github.com/lanl/OpenMS},
  }

In addition, if you use MEEP to solve Maxwell equations, please cite MEEP paper:
> A. Oskooi, D. Roundy, M. Ibanescu, P. Bermel, J.D. Joannopoulos, and S.G. Johnson, [MEEP: A flexible free-software package for electromagnetic simulations by the FDTD method](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.cpc.2009.11.008), Computer Physics Communications, Vol. 181, pp. 687-702 (2010) ([pdf](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/~oskooi/papers/Oskooi10.pdf)).

If you use TiledArray for tensor contraction, please cite TiledArray paper:
> "TiledArray: A general-purpose scalable block-sparse tensor framework", Justus A. Calvin and Edward F. Valeev, https://github.com/valeevgroup/tiledarray .

For specific features used in the calculation, a citation recommendation is listed at the end of the output.
